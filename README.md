# UFOs Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a filtered table for my client to add more functionality to her website on UFO sightings. The website will be used as a central hub for all accounts involving Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The website can be accessed and used for people who would like to search for different sightings. The added functionality of a search allows for users to find results on a small set of search criteria.

## Results
Here is the main page.
